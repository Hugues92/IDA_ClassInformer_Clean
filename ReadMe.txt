Changes to MSVC vftables in IDA_ClassInformer_Clean:
====================================================
	Undefine all the automated virtual function names generated by IDA_ClassInformer_Modified (all naming convention versions I went through).
	Original use was to clean my oldest database so I could properly change the naming convention of classes struct and virtual functions.
	Also helpful when correcting a bug with IDA_ClassInformer_Modified :)
